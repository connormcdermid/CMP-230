# CMP-230 Netwide Assembly Programs

This repository contains my work for the Fall 2021 semester of CMP-230 Computer Architecture and Assembly Language.

Included are my labs, the professor's macro and procedure libraries, and the professor's assembler and linker script.

###Labs
Lab assignments can be found on [the professor's website](http://cullenprogramming.homelinux.com/profnotes.html#cmp230).

### Libraries
The professor has provided two libraries:
* "Macros\_CPsub64.inc"
* "CPsub64.inc"

for our usage.

### Assembler Script
The professor has provided a bash script to assemble our programs -- "asmlink". I have modified it to make the assembled
programs compatible with gdb.

## Prerequisites
In order to assemble and programs included here, you must have the following packages:
* gcc version 11 or greater
* nasm version 2 or greater

Program names are not included with labs on professor's website. A list follows:
1. helloworld2.asm
2. promptecho.asm
3. cmdargs.asm
4. numrep.asm
5. arithmetic.asm
6. arithmetic2.asm
7. fibonacci.asm
